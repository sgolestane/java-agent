/**
 * An {@link LlmClient} decorator that enforces a {@link TokenBudget} across a run,
 * so an unsupervised agent cannot burn unbounded tokens (or dollars).
 *
 * <p>It accumulates the {@link TokenUsage} of every response and, before each call,
 * refuses to proceed once the budget is exhausted by throwing a
 * {@link BudgetExceededException}. The check is a pre-flight guard on the spend so
 * far — a turn's cost is unknown until it returns — so the turn that first reaches
 * the cap still completes and its answer is delivered; the <em>next</em> turn is the
 * one that is refused. The agent loop turns that exception into a
 * {@code BUDGET_EXHAUSTED} stop.
 *
 * <p>Place this decorator <em>outside</em> a {@link RetryingLlmClient} (budget wraps
 * retry) so retries count against the budget and a budget stop is never itself
 * retried. The running total is thread-safe, but the check-then-call is not one
 * atomic step; under concurrent callers the cap is approximate — fine for a single
 * agent loop, which calls serially.
 *
 * <p>The tally is instance state that spans every call, so one instance tracks
 * <em>one run</em>: build a fresh {@code BudgetLlmClient} per run, or call
 * {@link #reset()} between runs, otherwise a reused instance carries its spend
 * forward and a later run can start already exhausted. For the same reason this
 * belongs in the in-process agent loop and <em>not</em> inside a Temporal activity,
 * where the instance would be shared across every workflow the worker serves and a
 * thrown {@link BudgetExceededException} would be retried by Temporal.
